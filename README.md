# Capstone 2019 - Team Empower

## Project Description

Home Care Aides (HCAs) are the future of long-term care in the USA, allowing older adults and people with disabilities live in the community, and age in place.

We know that
- a significant proportion of our workforce have high rates of chronic disease
- the HCA population is socio-economically disadvantaged

But what we do not know is: __The prevalence, and determinants of disparities in chronic disease conditions within the HCA population in the state of Washington__

It is imperative to know empirically how are chronic diseases disproportionately represented among certain groups within the HCA population so that we develop evidence based interventions, both preventive and curative. Evidence from this project will
- help with appropriate allocation of resources to address health disparities
- track progress in health outcomes over time
- Generate information on a vulnerable group of health care providers about whom we know very little


The primary objective of the health disparities project is to __understand disparities in the prevalence of chronic disease in the HCA population using the claims data.__
